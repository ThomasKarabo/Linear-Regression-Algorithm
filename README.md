## Overview

Linear regression is a basic yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous outcomes. This project implements the algorithm from scratch using Python and Jupyter Notebook to provide educational insight into its workings.

## Features

- Clear and concise implementation of linear regression.
- Demonstrates gradient descent for model optimization.
- Includes example datasets for testing and visualization.
- Interactive notebooks for hands-on learning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThomasKarabo/Linear-Regression-Algorithm.git
   cd Linear-Regression-Algorithm
